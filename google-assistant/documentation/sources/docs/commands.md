# Actions & Commands

## Actions

If you add devices connected to Google Assistant, you can easily control them through A.V.A.T.A.R. For example, you can manage a thermostat, a heater, a vacuum cleaner, light bulbs, and many other devices.

Check the documentation for each device to discover the associated voice commands, so you can use them effectively. Then, simply tell A.V.A.T.A.R the corresponding command to interact with your device.
