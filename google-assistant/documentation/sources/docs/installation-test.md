# Installation test

Dictate a simple rule, for example, to know the time (first verify if a `time` plugin is already present in A.V.A.T.A.R, if so, disable it first otherwise the plugin will answer you.)

Do not forget the trigger keyword (e.g. `sarah` or `jarvis`)!

???+ info
    If A.V.A.T.A.R does not respond, make sure you have followed all the steps for creating the access keys and, if necessary, redo the missed steps.  
    As a last resort, you can delete the project and redo it by strictly following the installation documentation.  
    If you still encounter issues, post a message on the forum.
